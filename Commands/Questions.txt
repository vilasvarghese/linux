	INFINITE COMPUTER SOLUTIONS - LINUX FIRST ASSESSMENT
	----------------------------------------------------

Question 1 
A user reports that a new configuration setting in /etc/myapp/config.conf isn't taking effect. 
You suspect a simple typo in a single line. You just want to quickly see the entire content of this small configuration file (it's rarely more than 20 lines) without any paging.


Question 2 
The apache web server is experiencing intermittent errors. You need to review the very latest entries in the error.log file (/var/log/apache2/error.log) to identify any immediate issues. You only need to see the last 10 lines.


Question 3 
You've just restarted a critical service and want to ensure it's starting up correctly. Its log file (/var/log/critical_service.log) is constantly being updated. You need to watch new entries in real-time.


Question 4 
A background daemon failed to start after a system reboot. Its detailed startup logs are in /var/log/daemon/init.log. You know the crucial initialization sequence happens within the first 30 lines. How would you check it?



Question 5 
You've downloaded a CHANGELOG.md file for a new software package. It's about 100 lines long, and you just want to read through it page by page without needing to jump around or search extensively.





Scenario: You are a system administrator automating tasks, troubleshooting issues, and managing data flow on a Linux server.

Question 6: You want to list all files in the current directory (including hidden files) and save the complete output to a file named all_files.txt.

Question 7: You need to append the current date to the end of a log file named activity.log without overwriting its existing content.


Question 8: You have a long list of users in /etc/passwd. You want to filter this list to only show lines containing "bash" the results alphabetically before displaying them.

Question 9: You want to login to a remote server with ip 10.20.30.40. You can user user vilas and pem file test.pem.


Question 10: You need to create an empty file named audit.log. Give at least 2 different ways 


Question 11: You want to display the first 5 lines of /var/log/messages and append these lines to a file named quick_messages.txt.





Scenario: You are investigating performance, resource utilization, and system events on a Linux server.

Question 12: The server feels sluggish. You want to quickly identify which processes are consuming the most CPU in real-time and kill that process. How do you do that?



Question 13: You prefer a more visually intuitive process monitor that allows you to easily scroll, sort by different columns (e.g., memory, CPU), and see a tree view of processes.

Question 14: You suspect a disk I/O bottleneck. You want to see a snapshot of disk (block) I/O activity, along with CPU and memory statistics.


Question 15: A critical service, apache2, failed unexpectedly a few minutes ago. You need to examine its systemd journal logs to understand what happened.






Scenario : You are managing file and directory permissions and ownership on a multi-user Linux system to ensure security and proper access control.

Question 16: A new script daily_backup.sh was created. Make root owner of and give full read, write, and execute permissions, but no one else should have any access.


Question 17: A shared configuration file app.conf needs to be readable and writable by its owner (admin), readable by members of the devs group, and have no access for others.

Question 18: You've created a new project directory /var/www/myproject. All files and subdirectories within it should be owned by apache user and www-data group.

Question 19: A new temporary directory /tmp/myfiles was created by userA. userB needs to be able to create files in it, but userA should still own the directory.






Scenario: You are a system administrator monitoring and troubleshooting processes on a Linux server.

Question 20: The server feels sluggish, and you suspect a runaway process. You want to see a comprehensive list of all running processes on the system, including those not associated with a terminal, along with their owner and CPU/memory usage.

Question: You need to find a specific process named "apache2" to check if it's running and get its Process ID (PID). You prefer the System V style output format.


Question 21: A user reports that their Python script, my_script.py, is not running. You want to quickly check if any process related to my_script.py is active, regardless of its exact command line arguments.





Scenario: You are performing network diagnostics, downloading files, and transferring data between servers.

Question 22: You need to download a file named latest_release.tar.gz from http://example.com/downloads/ to your current directory. You prefer a simple, non-interactive download that shows progress.

Question: You want to test if a web server at example.com is reachable on its default HTTPS port (443) and view the HTTP headers it sends in response.

Question 23: You need to check which network interfaces/devices are active on your system, their assigned IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and their MAC addresses.



Question 24: You need to see all established TCP connections on your server, displaying IP addresses and port numbers numerically without resolving hostnames.




Scenario: You need to securely transfer files and execute commands on remote Linux servers.

Question 25: You need to securely copy a local file named my_document.txt to the home directory of user1 on a remote server with IP address 192.168.1.10.

Question 26: You want to log in to a remote server server.example.com as user admin and get an interactive shell.






Scenario: You are a system administrator managing processes on a busy Linux server.


Question 27: A specific application process (e.g., a web server instance) has become unresponsive and is consuming excessive CPU resources. You've identified its PID as 12345. You want to send a graceful termination signal to the process, allowing it to clean up before exiting.




Scenario: You are troubleshooting performance issues and resource utilization on a Linux server.

Question 28: The server feels very slow. You want to quickly identify which processes are consuming the most CPU and memory in real-time, along with their owner and uptime. You need an interactive display that updates regularly.








Scenario: You are backing up data, moving files, or packaging software on a Linux system.

Question 29: You need to create a compressed archive of a directory named my_project (located in your current working directory) for backup purposes. The archive should be named my_project_backup.tar.gz.

Question 30: You've received a compressed archive file named data_archive.tar.bz2 and need to extract its contents into the current directory.



Scenario: You are monitoring disk space on a server to prevent out-of-disk errors and optimize storage.

Question 31: You need a quick overview of disk space usage for all mounted filesystems on your server, displayed in a human-readable format (e.g., GB, MB).

Scenario: You are investigating which files or directories are consuming the most disk space to free up resources.

Question 32: Your /var/log directory seems very large. You want to find out the disk space usage of all subdirectories immediately under /var/log, displayed in a human-readable format.


Question 33: You need to find the top 5 largest files or directories within your current working directory and its subdirectories.





Scenario: You are analyzing text files or command outputs for statistical purposes.

Question 34: You have a log file named access.log. You want to find out how many lines, words, and characters are in this file.

Question 35: You want to count only the number of files (lines) returned by the ls -l command in the current directory, without saving the output to a file.







Scenario: You are optimizing scripts or commands and need to measure their execution performance.

Question 36: You have a script named data_processing.sh that takes a long time to run. You want to measure the total time it takes to execute the script (./data_processing.sh), including real, user, and sys time, to identify potential bottlenecks. 



Question 37: You've been working in various directories and now you're unsure of your current location in the file system. You need to quickly display the full path of your current working directory.


Question 38: You want to see the names of all files and subdirectories within your home directory. You want to do a long listing to find timestamp, owner etc.


Question 39: You suspect there might be hidden configuration files in your home directory that you can't see with a regular ls. You want to list all files, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot . ).

Question 40: You need to go up one level from your current directory (e.g., if you are in /home/user/documents, you want to go to /home/user).


Question 41: You were in /etc/nginx/sites-available but then moved to /var/log/apache2. Now you want to quickly jump back to /etc/nginx/sites-available without typing the full path.


Question 42: You want to list all files and directories in a specific path, /home/shared/data, without actually changing your current directory. You need to see hidden files and details.
