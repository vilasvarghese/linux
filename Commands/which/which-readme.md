# Linux `which` Command Tutorial (Detailed)

The `which` command in Linux is a simple yet very useful utility that helps you locate the executable file (binary) of a command in your system's `PATH` environment variable. When you type a command in the terminal (like `ls`, `grep`, `python`, etc.), the shell searches for its executable in a list of directories specified by the `PATH` variable. `which` performs the same search and tells you the full path to the executable that would be run.

## Basic Syntax

```bash
which [OPTIONS] COMMAND_NAME...
COMMAND_NAME...: One or more command names you want to locate.

How which Works
Environment Variable PATH: which works by searching through the directories listed in your shell's PATH environment variable. The PATH is a colon-separated list of directories where the shell looks for executable programs. You can view your current PATH using:

Bash

echo $PATH
Example Output:

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
Order of Search: which searches the directories in the PATH from left to right. The first executable found with the given COMMAND_NAME is the one it reports.

Executables Only: which is specifically designed to find executable files. It will not find shell built-in commands (like cd, echo, pwd), shell functions, or aliases unless specified with options.

Examples and Use Cases
1. Basic Usage: Find the Path to a Command
Bash

which ls
which python3
which nano
Example Output for which ls:

/usr/bin/ls
This means when you type ls, the system executes the binary located at /usr/bin/ls.

2. Find Multiple Commands
You can specify multiple command names at once.

Bash

which ls grep find
Example Output:

/usr/bin/ls
/usr/bin/grep
/usr/bin/find
3. Understanding which vs. Shell Built-ins/Aliases/Functions
which by default only finds executables on the disk. It does not resolve shell built-ins, aliases, or functions.

Let's illustrate:

Bash

# Create an alias
alias ll='ls -alF'

# Create a shell function
my_function() {
    echo "This is my custom function."
}

# Try to find 'cd' (a shell built-in)
which cd

# Try to find the alias 'll'
which ll

# Try to find the function 'my_function'
which my_function
Output:

# For 'which cd', 'which ll', 'which my_function', you might get no output or an error:
# cd: shell built-in command
# no ll in (/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:...)
# no my_function in (...
This demonstrates that which doesn't see these.

4. Resolving Aliases and Functions (--skip-alias, --skip-functions)
While which by default skips aliases and functions, you can explicitly tell it to skip them if you're worried about misinterpretation, or use shell-specific commands to resolve them.

--skip-alias: Ignore aliases.

--skip-functions: Ignore functions.

These are primarily used to ensure you get the actual binary path if an alias or function with the same name exists.

Bash

# Assuming 'll' alias and 'my_function' exist as above
which --skip-alias ll
which --skip-functions my_function
The output would still likely be "no ll/my_function in..." because which doesn't look for them unless specified, and these options tell it not to consider them.

To find information about aliases, built-ins, and functions, use the type command:

Bash

type cd
type ll
type my_function
type ls
Output for type:

cd is a shell builtin
ll is aliased to `ls -alF'
my_function is a function
my_function ()
{
    echo "This is my custom function."
}
ls is /usr/bin/ls
type is generally more comprehensive for understanding how your shell will execute a given command name.

5. Finding All Matches in PATH (-a)
By default, which stops at the first executable it finds. The -a (or --all) option makes it print all matching executables found in the PATH.

Bash

which -a python
If you have multiple Python versions installed in different PATH locations (e.g., /usr/bin/python and /usr/local/bin/python), this will show all of them.

Example:

Bash

/usr/bin/python
/usr/local/bin/python
The one that would be executed is the first one listed.

6. Ignoring Non-Executable Files (-s)
The -s (or --skip-dot-files) option skips dot files (hidden files) that are also executables. This is less commonly used.

7. Exit Status
which returns an exit status:

0: If all specified commands are found.

1: If one or more specified commands are not found.

This makes which useful in shell scripts for checking if a command exists before attempting to use it.

Bash

if which docker > /dev/null; then
    echo "Docker is installed."
else
    echo "Docker is not found in PATH."
fi
> /dev/null redirects standard output to null, so which doesn't print its path to the console.

The if statement checks the exit status.

When to use which?
Locating Executables: The primary use case is to find the exact location of a command's binary file.

Debugging PATH Issues: If a command isn't running as expected, which can help you confirm if it's found in your PATH and which version is being picked up.

Scripting: Checking for the existence of commands before execution in shell scripts.

Confirming Installation: After installing a new software package, which can confirm if its executable is now accessible via PATH.

Understanding Command Precedence: If multiple versions of a program exist (e.g., different Python versions), which (without -a) shows you which one will be executed by default.

Limitations
No Shell Built-ins/Functions/Aliases: As noted, which does not resolve shell built-in commands (cd, pwd), shell functions, or aliases. For these, type is the appropriate command.

Only PATH: It only searches directories listed in PATH. It won't find executables located elsewhere on the filesystem unless those directories are added to PATH.

Symbolic Links: If a command is a symbolic link (e.g., /usr/bin/python might be a symlink to python3.8), which will typically show the symlink's path, not the actual target. To resolve symlinks, you might need readlink -f.

In summary, which is a straightforward and effective tool for quickly finding the disk location of executable programs that your shell would run. For a more comprehensive understanding of command resolution (including built-ins and aliases), use the type command.
