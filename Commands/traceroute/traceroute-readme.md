# Linux `traceroute` Command Tutorial (Detailed)

The `traceroute` command in Linux is a network diagnostic tool used to display the route (path) and measure transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It works by sending packets with gradually increasing Time To Live (TTL) values, allowing it to discover the intermediate routers (hops) that packets traverse to reach a destination host. This information is invaluable for troubleshooting network connectivity, identifying bottlenecks, and understanding network topology.

## Basic Syntax

```bash
traceroute [OPTIONS] HOST
OPTIONS: Control the behavior of traceroute (e.g., protocol, port, max hops).

HOST: The hostname or IP address of the destination you want to trace.

How traceroute Works (The TTL Mechanism)
traceroute typically works by sending a sequence of UDP datagrams (or ICMP Echo Request packets, or TCP SYN packets, depending on options) to the destination host, starting with a TTL (Time To Live) value of 1.

TTL = 1: The first packet is sent with a TTL of 1. When this packet reaches the first router on the path, the router decrements the TTL to 0 and, according to IP protocol rules, drops the packet. It then sends an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message back to the traceroute source. traceroute records the IP address of this router and the round-trip time.

TTL = 2: The second packet is sent with a TTL of 2. It passes the first router (TTL becomes 1) and reaches the second router. The second router decrements TTL to 0, drops the packet, and sends an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message back. traceroute records the second router's IP and RTT.

This process continues, incrementing the TTL by 1 for each subsequent packet.

Destination Reached: When the packet finally reaches the destination host, the TTL will be sufficient (TTL > 0). If using UDP, the packet will typically be sent to an unusual, unassigned port. The destination host, finding no application listening on that port, sends an ICMP "Port Unreachable" message back to the traceroute source. This Port Unreachable message signals to traceroute that the destination has been reached. If using ICMP Echo Request, the destination responds with an ICMP Echo Reply.

For each TTL value (each hop), traceroute sends three packets by default to measure the RTT more accurately and account for packet loss. The output shows the IP address of each hop and the RTT for each of the three packets. If a packet is lost or no response is received within the timeout, an asterisk (*) is displayed.

Common Options
-I (or --icmp): Use ICMP Echo Request packets for probing instead of UDP datagrams. This is often necessary if firewalls block UDP.

-T (or --tcp): Use TCP SYN packets for probing. This is useful for tracing through firewalls that might filter UDP or ICMP. You can also specify the destination port with -p.

-p PORT (or --port=PORT): Set the destination port for UDP or TCP probes. Default for UDP is 33434. For TCP, default is 80.

-n (or --numeric): Do not resolve IP addresses to hostnames. This speeds up output, as it avoids DNS lookups.

-q NUM (or --queries=NUM): Set the number of probe packets per hop. Default is 3. Increase for more reliable RTT measurements, decrease to speed up.

-m MAX_TTL (or --max-hops=MAX_TTL): Set the maximum number of hops (TTL value) traceroute will try. Default is 30.

-w SECONDS (or --wait=SECONDS): Set the time to wait for a probe response (timeout). Default is 5 seconds.

-g GATEWAY (or --gateway=GATEWAY): Specify a loose source route gateway (rarely used).

-i INTERFACE (or --interface=INTERFACE): Specify the outgoing interface.

-F (or --dont-fragment): Do not fragment probe packets. Forces packets to be sent with the DF bit set. If an intermediate router needs to fragment it but the DF bit is set, it will drop the packet and send an ICMP "Fragmentation Needed" error. Useful for Path MTU Discovery.

-U (or --udp-port=PORT): (Specific to some traceroute versions) Use a fixed source UDP port.

-v (or --verbose): Verbose output.

Examples and Use Cases
1. Basic Trace to a Host
Bash

traceroute google.com
Example Output (excerpt):

traceroute to google.com (142.250.193.174), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  _gateway (192.168.1.1)  0.728 ms  0.647 ms  0.706 ms
 2  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  4.345 ms  4.020 ms  4.567 ms
 3  103.1.2.3 (103.1.2.3)  12.780 ms  13.432 ms  12.987 ms
 4  * * *
 5  static-2402-12-34-56.abc.in (2402:123:45:67::1)  25.123 ms  24.890 ms  25.340 ms
 6  142.250.224.234 (142.250.224.234)  28.567 ms  28.901 ms  28.789 ms
 7  142.250.193.174 (142.250.193.174)  29.123 ms  29.001 ms  29.345 ms
1: Hop number (TTL value).

_gateway (192.168.1.1): Hostname (if resolved) and IP address of the router at this hop.

0.728 ms 0.647 ms 0.706 ms: Round-trip times for each of the three probe packets sent to this hop.

* * *: Indicates that no response was received for any of the three probes for that hop (e.g., router is dropping packets, firewall, network congestion).

2. Numeric Output (No DNS Resolution) (-n)
Speeds up the trace by skipping DNS lookups for each hop.

Bash

traceroute -n 8.8.8.8
Example Output (excerpt):

traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
 1  192.168.1.1  0.728 ms  0.647 ms  0.706 ms
 2  10.0.0.1  4.345 ms  4.020 ms  4.567 ms
...
3. Using ICMP Echo Probes (-I)
Useful if UDP probes are blocked by firewalls.

Bash

sudo traceroute -I example.com
You often need sudo when using ICMP probes due to raw socket requirements.

4. Using TCP SYN Probes (-T) to a Specific Port
Excellent for checking if a specific service port is reachable through firewalls.

Bash

sudo traceroute -T -p 80 google.com
Explanation:

-T: Use TCP SYN probes.

-p 80: Send probes to destination port 80 (HTTP). If the destination responds with a TCP RST (reset) or SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge), traceroute considers the hop reached. This is often how firewalls differentiate between allowed and blocked traffic.

5. Adjusting Number of Probes per Hop (-q)
Increase to get a more accurate average RTT or to detect intermittent packet loss.

Bash

traceroute -q 5 example.com
This sends 5 probe packets per hop instead of the default 3.

6. Setting Maximum Hops (-m)
Limit the depth of the trace.

Bash

traceroute -m 10 google.com
This will stop tracing after 10 hops, even if the destination isn't reached. Useful for quick checks or to avoid long traces.

7. Setting Timeout per Probe (-w)
Increase the timeout if tracing to distant or heavily loaded networks where responses might be slow.

Bash

traceroute -w 10 example.com
This waits up to 10 seconds for each probe response.

8. Specifying Outgoing Interface (-i)
Useful on multi-homed systems (systems with multiple network interfaces).

Bash

traceroute -i eth0 google.com
Replace eth0 with your actual interface name (e.g., enp0s3, wlan0).

9. Don't Fragment Packets (-F) - Path MTU Discovery
Bash

traceroute -F example.com
This sets the "Don't Fragment" bit. If a router on the path needs to fragment the packet but the DF bit is set, it will drop the packet and send an ICMP "Fragmentation Needed" message back. This helps in diagnosing Path MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) issues.

Interpreting traceroute Output
* * * (Asterisks):

Packet Loss/Filtering: Often indicates that a router is not responding to ICMP Time Exceeded messages, or a firewall is blocking the probes.

Congestion: High packet loss over multiple hops can indicate network congestion.

Reverse Path Filtering (RPF): Some routers implement RPF, where they drop packets if the return path isn't through the same interface the packet arrived on. This can make traceroute appear to fail even if the forward path is working.

High RTT values: Indicate latency or congestion at that specific hop or a slow link leading to it.

Changing IP addresses: A change in IP address or hostnames between consecutive probes to the same hop can indicate ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) routing, where traffic is load-balanced across multiple paths.

!H (Host unreachable), !N (Network unreachable), !P (Protocol unreachable): These are ICMP error messages directly from a router or the destination, indicating a problem at that point. !P (port unreachable) is the expected response from the destination when using UDP probes, signaling success.

Time-outs at the end, but the service is reachable: This often means the destination or a firewall near it is blocking ICMP/UDP probes but is still passing application-level traffic (e.g., HTTP on port 80). Using -T -p might confirm this.

Troubleshooting with traceroute
Is the destination reachable? If the trace completes successfully (you see the destination IP/hostname at the end), connectivity exists.

Where is the problem? If the trace stops or shows consistent * * * at a particular hop and beyond, the problem likely lies with that router or the network segment immediately after it.

Identify bottlenecks: High RTT values at specific hops can pinpoint slow links or congested routers.

Firewall issues: If UDP or ICMP probes fail but TCP probes on a service port succeed (e.g., traceroute -T -p 80), it indicates that a firewall is filtering non-application specific traffic.

Routing loops: Unusual hop sequences or continually increasing hop counts without reaching the destination can suggest routing loops (though less common with modern routing protocols).

traceroute vs. ping
ping: Checks basic reachability and measures RTT to a single destination. It tells you if you can reach it and how long it takes.

traceroute: Maps the path to a destination, identifies each hop, and measures RTT to each intermediate hop. It tells you how you reach it and where delays or failures occur.

Both are essential tools for network diagnostics and are often used together.

By understanding and utilizing the various options and output of traceroute, you can effectively diagnose and troubleshoot network connectivity issues on Linux systems.
