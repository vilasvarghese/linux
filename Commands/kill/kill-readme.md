# Linux `kill` Command Tutorial

The `kill` command in Linux is used to send signals to processes. While its name suggests termination, its primary function is to send a specified signal, which can include signals to gracefully terminate, forcefully kill, pause, or resume a process. The most common use is to terminate processes.

## Basic Syntax

```
kill [OPTION]... <PID>...
PID: Process ID. You need to know the PID of the process you want to send a signal to.

Understanding Signals
Signals are a form of inter-process communication (IPC). When you send a signal to a process, you are essentially notifying it of an event. Processes can be programmed to respond to certain signals in specific ways.

You can see a list of all available signals on your system using kill -l or man 7 signal. Some common and important signals include:

1 (SIGHUP): Hangup. Often used to tell a process to re-read its configuration files without restarting. Many daemons (background services) are programmed to reload on SIGHUP.

2 (SIGINT): Interrupt. Sent by Ctrl+C in a terminal. Usually tells a process to terminate gracefully.

9 (SIGKILL): Kill. This is the forceful, non-catchable, non-ignorable kill signal. The process cannot ignore it. It immediately terminates the process. Use with caution as it does not allow the process to clean up (e.g., save unsaved data, close files properly).

15 (SIGTERM): Terminate. This is the default and most common signal used to terminate a process gracefully. It requests the process to shut down. The process can catch this signal, perform cleanup, and then exit.

18 (SIGCONT): Continue. Resumes a stopped process.

19 (SIGSTOP): Stop. Pauses a process. Unlike SIGTSTP (Ctrl+Z), SIGSTOP cannot be ignored by the process.

Important Note: When using kill without specifying a signal, it defaults to SIGTERM (15).

How to Find a Process's PID
Before you can kill a process, you need its PID (Process ID). Here are common ways to find it:

1. Using ps
ps shows current processes. Combine it with grep to filter.



ps aux | grep firefox
a: Show processes for all users.

u: Display user/owner.

x: Show processes not attached to a terminal.

The PID is usually the second column. Be careful, as grep firefox itself will show up in the output. Look for the actual application process.

Example output:

user   12345 15.0  2.5 1234568 250000 ? Sl   Jul24 123:45 /usr/lib/firefox/firefox
Here, 12345 would be the PID.

2. Using pgrep
pgrep is specifically designed to find PIDs by name.



pgrep firefox
This will directly output the PIDs of processes whose names match firefox.

3. Using pidof
pidof also finds the PID of a running program.



pidof firefox
Similar to pgrep, it outputs the PIDs.

4. Using htop or top
Interactive tools like htop and top display PIDs clearly. You can often press k within top or F9 within htop to kill selected processes interactively.

Examples of Using kill
1. Gracefully terminate a process (default SIGTERM):


kill 12345
This sends SIGTERM (signal 15) to the process with PID 12345. The process has a chance to clean up and exit. This is the preferred way to terminate.

2. Forcefully terminate a process (SIGKILL):


kill -9 12345
Or using the signal name:



kill -KILL 12345
This sends SIGKILL (signal 9) to PID 12345. The process is immediately terminated without any chance for cleanup. Use this only if kill 12345 (SIGTERM) doesn't work.

3. Reload a process (SIGHUP):


kill -1 54321
Or:



kill -HUP 54321
This sends SIGHUP (signal 1) to PID 54321. Many server applications (like web servers, mail servers, daemons) are configured to reload their configuration files when they receive a SIGHUP.

4. Pause a process (SIGSTOP) and resume (SIGCONT):
To pause a process:



kill -19 12345
# Or
kill -STOP 12345
The process will suspend execution. It will not be using CPU time.

To resume a paused process:



kill -18 12345
# Or
kill -CONT 12345
The process will resume its execution from where it left off.

5. Kill multiple processes:
You can specify multiple PIDs with one kill command.



kill 12345 67890 11223
6. Using killall (Kill by Name)
The killall command is a convenient way to kill processes by their name instead of their PID. It sends a signal to all processes matching the specified name.



killall firefox
This will send SIGTERM to all running firefox processes.

To forcefully kill all firefox processes:



killall -9 firefox
Caution with killall: Be very careful with killall, especially when using -9. If you accidentally type a common command name (e.g., killall ), you could terminate your own terminal session or other critical system processes. Always test with pgrep first if unsure: pgrep firefox.

7. Using pkill (Kill by Pattern)
pkill is similar to pgrep but directly sends the signal. It's more powerful than killall because it allows for more flexible pattern matching (regular expressions).



pkill -9 -f "my_script.py"
-f: Matches the full command line, not just the process name. This is useful if the process name itself is generic (e.g., python, java).

Example: Kill all ssh connections for a specific user.



pkill -9 -u username sshd
Permissions
You can only kill processes that you own. To kill processes owned by other users (including root processes like system daemons), you need root privileges (e.g., using sudo).



sudo kill 9876
sudo kill -9 54321
When to use which signal?
SIGTERM (15): Always try this first. It's polite and gives the process a chance to clean up.

SIGKILL (9): Use this as a last resort if SIGTERM fails to terminate a hung or unresponsive process.

SIGHUP (1): For daemon processes that you want to reload their configuration without downtime.

Understanding and using the kill command effectively is a fundamental skill for Linux system administration and troubleshooting.
