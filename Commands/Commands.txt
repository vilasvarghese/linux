In Linux, file permissions are an essential aspect of the operating system's security model. They control access to files and directories, determining who can read, write, and execute them. Linux uses a combination of permission bits and ownership to manage file access. Understanding and managing file permissions are crucial for maintaining system security and ensuring data integrity.

Linux File Permission Types:

    Read (r): Allows the user to read the file's content and view its attributes (e.g., permissions, owner, group).
    Write (w): Allows the user to modify the file's content and attributes. Users with write access can also delete the file or modify its permissions.
    Execute (x): Allows the user to execute the file if it is a script or a binary executable. For directories, execute permission is necessary to access its contents (i.e., list files and directories within).

File Permission Classes:

    User (Owner): The owner of the file.
    Group: A group of users that share the same permissions.
    Others: Any other user on the system who is not the owner or part of the group.

File Permission Representation:
File permissions are represented by a 10-character string, where the first character represents the file type (e.g., "-" for regular files, "d" for directories). The next three characters represent permissions for the user, followed by three characters for the group, and the last three characters for others. Each character can be "r" for read, "w" for write, and "x" for execute. If a permission is not granted, it is represented by "-".

Examples of File Permission Representations:

    rw-r--r-- (Owner: Read/Write, Group: Read, Others: Read)
    drwxr-xr-x (Owner: Read/Write/Execute, Group: Read/Execute, Others: Read/Execute)

Changing File Permissions:
File permissions can be modified using the "chmod" command. Permissions can be set explicitly using numeric values (e.g., 755, 644) or using symbolic notation (e.g., u+r, g+w).

File Ownership:
Each file in Linux is associated with an owner and a group. The owner has special privileges, such as changing permissions and changing the file's group. The "chown" command is used to change file ownership, while "chgrp" changes the group ownership.

Default File Permissions:
The "umask" command determines the default permissions assigned to new files and directories created by users. It is subtracted from a maximum value (usually 777 for directories and 666 for files) to calculate the actual permissions.

In summary, file permissions in Linux play a critical role in controlling access to files and ensuring system security. Properly managing file permissions is essential to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the system.






File permission management in Linux is essential for controlling access to files and directories. Here are some commands commonly used to manage file permissions:

    chmod: Change file permissions.
        Syntax: chmod [options] permissions filename
        Example: chmod u+rwx file.txt (Grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner of the file.)

    chown: Change file ownership.
        Syntax: chown [options] owner[:group] filename
        Example: chown john:users file.txt (Changes the owner of the file to "john" and the group to "users.")

    chgrp: Change file group ownership.
        Syntax: chgrp [options] group filename
        Example: chgrp users file.txt (Changes the group ownership of the file to "users.")

    umask: Set the default file permissions for newly created files and directories.
        Syntax: umask [mode]
        Example: umask 0022 (Sets the default permissions for newly created files to 644 and directories to 755.)

    ls: List files and directories with their permissions.
        Syntax: ls -l [filename]
        Example: ls -l file.txt (Displays the permissions of "file.txt" along with other file attributes.)

    id: Display user and group information.
        Syntax: id [username]
        Example: id john (Displays information about the user "john," including their primary group.)

    groups: Display the groups a user belongs to.
        Syntax: groups [username]
        Example: groups john (Shows the groups that the user "john" is a member of.)

    su: Switch user or become the superuser.
        Syntax: su [username]
        Example: su john (Switches to user "john" and prompts for their password.)

    sudo: Execute a command with administrative privileges.
        Syntax: sudo [command]
        Example: sudo ls /root (Lists the contents of the "/root" directory with root privileges.)

    adduser: Create a new user account.
        Syntax: adduser [username]
        Example: adduser jane (Creates a new user account named "jane.")

    deluser: Delete a user account.
        Syntax: deluser [username]
        Example: deluser jane (Deletes the user account "jane.")

    passwd: Change user password.
        Syntax: passwd [username]
        Example: passwd john (Prompts to change the password for user "john.")

    getfacl: Display file access control lists (ACLs).
        Syntax: getfacl [filename]
        Example: getfacl file.txt (Shows the ACLs associated with "file.txt.")

    setfacl: Set file access control lists (ACLs).
        Syntax: setfacl [options] acl-specification filename
        Example: setfacl -m u:john:rw file.txt (Grants read and write permissions to user "john" on "file.txt.")
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
• User Creation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the useradd command followed by the desired username to create the new user. For example, to create a user named "john":


	sudo useradd john

This command will create a new user account with default settings, including the user's home directory (usually located in /home/username).

Set a password for the new user using the passwd command:



	sudo passwd john

You'll be prompted to enter and confirm the password for the new user.

Optionally, you can provide additional user information, such as the user's full name, phone number, or other details, using the useradd command with the -c flag:



	sudo useradd -c "John Doe" john

By default, a new user will be a member of their own group with the same name as the username. If you want to add the user to an existing group, use the -G flag:



	sudo useradd -G groupname john

Replace groupname with the name of the existing group.

If you want to create a user with a specific home directory, you can use the -d flag with the useradd command:



	sudo useradd -d /path/to/custom/home john

Replace /path/to/custom/home with the desired directory path.

To grant administrative privileges (sudo access) to the new user, add the user to the sudo group:



    sudo usermod -aG sudo john

    This command adds the user "john" to the sudo group, allowing them to run administrative commands with sudo.

    Finally, to ensure the changes take effect, restart the system or log out and log back in with the new user account.

That's it! You have successfully created a new user account in Linux. The new user can now log in and use the system with the specified username and password.

6. Writing Shell Scripts Programs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A shell script is a collection of commands written in a scripting language that the shell (command-line interpreter) can execute. In Linux and Unix-like operating systems, the shell (usually Bash) is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.

A shell script allows users to automate repetitive tasks, execute a sequence of commands, and perform complex operations by writing a series of commands in a text file. Shell scripts are lightweight, easy to create, and are often used for various administrative tasks, system maintenance, data processing, and automation.

Overview of Writing a Shell Script:

    Choose a Shell: Most Linux systems use the Bash shell as the default. However, other shells like Zsh, Ksh, and Dash are also available. Decide which shell you want to use based on your requirements.

    Create a New File: Use a text editor (e.g., nano, vi, or vscode) to create a new file for your shell script. Give it a .sh extension to indicate that it's a shell script.

    Specify the Shell: Start the script with a "shebang" line to specify the shell to be used. For Bash scripts, the shebang is typically #!/bin/bash. For other shells, adjust accordingly.

    Write Your Script: Add the desired commands to your script, one per line. You can include variable assignments, loops, conditional statements, function definitions, and command-line arguments.

    Save the Script: Save the script file in an appropriate location. Make sure the file is executable to run it.

    Make the Script Executable: Use the chmod command to make the script executable by the user. For example: chmod +x your_script.sh

    Execute the Script: Run the script by typing its filename preceded by ./ in the terminal. For example: ./your_script.sh

Example Shell Script:

Here's a simple example of a shell script that prompts the user for their name and greets them:

bash

#!/bin/bash

# Prompt the user for their name
echo "Hello! What's your name?"
read name

# Greet the user with a personalized message
echo "Hello, $name! Welcome to the world of shell scripting!"

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter your name and display a personalized greeting message.

Remember that shell scripts are versatile and can perform a wide range of tasks. As you gain experience, you can write more complex scripts to automate various tasks and streamline your workflow. Always remember to test your scripts and ensure they work as expected before using them in a production environment.
